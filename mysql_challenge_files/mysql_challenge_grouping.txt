GROUPING DATA WITH SQL

When we looked at aggregate functions, we applied them to entire query results. We could get the maximum value in a particular field across all rows, or some subset of the rows, if we use a where clause. Often what we really want to do us group our data into a number of subsets, and use the aggregate functions on each of those. For example, counting how many tracks use each of the 5 different Media Types. SQL Provides a GROUP BY feature that allows us to do this.


Group By The AlbumId in the Track Table. Show the number of rows in each group. The results aren't very useful. We can see how many tracks are on each album, but not which album each result is for.
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track GROUP BY AlbumId;


Group By The AlbumId in the Track Table. Show the number of rows in each group, and the AlbumId for each. Better, now we can see which album each row relates to. But it's still only an Id
-- SELECT AlbumId, COUNT(*) FROM Track GROUP BY AlbumId;

Group By The AlbumId in the Track Table. Show the number of rows in each group, and the Album Title for each. Now we can see the title of the album each row relates to.
-- SELECT Album.Title, COUNT(*) FROM Track JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId GROUP BY Track.AlbumId;


The key to the group by is that the repeating value in the grouped column (AlbumId) defines a group of rows, that gets collapsed into one row. You can then use an Aggregate Function on that group, just as you previously did on entire query results. All of the aggregate functions work just as before.

Find the Cheapest Track on Each Album.
-- SELECT AlbumId, MIN(UnitPrice) FROM Track GROUP BY AlbumId;


Find the Most Expensive Track On Each Album.
-- SELECT AlbumId, MAX(UnitPrice) FROM Track GROUP BY AlbumId;


Find the total cost of each album
-- SELECT AlbumId, ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice), 2) FROM Track GROUP BY AlbumId;


Find the total cost of each album. But join to the Album table to include the Title of the Album.
-- SELECT Album.Title, ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice), 2) FROM Track INNER JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId GROUP BY Track.AlbumId;
