CHALLENGES
----------
Complete the following exercises, the expected results are shown, you need to write the queries.


BRONZE CHALLENGES
-----------------
1. Select the InvoiceDate, BillingAddress, and Total from the Invoices table, ordered by InvoiceDate Descending.

Expected : 412 rows (starting with the following)
2013-12-22 00:00:00      12,Community Centre                       1.99
2013-12-14 00:00:00      Porthaninkatu 9                           13.86
2013-12-09 00:00:00      Rua dos Campeões Europeus de Viena, 4350  8.91

-- SELECT InvoiceDate, BillingAddress, Total FROM Invoice ORDER BY InvoiceDate DESC limit 3;

2. We need to fire the last three people hired. Select the EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName and HireDate of the 3 Employees with the most recent HireDate.

Expected : 3 rows (starting with the following)
8   Laura   Callahan    2004-03-04 00:00:00
7   Robert  King        2004-01-02 00:00:00
5   Steve   Johnson     2003-10-17 00:00:00

-- SELECT EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, HireDate FROM Employee ORDER BY Hiredate DESC limit 3;

SILVER CHALLENGES
-----------------
3. Disaster, we've heard from Steve Johnson's lawyers. He claims that Michael Mitchell was hired on the same day as him, but was hired later in the day. Mitchell should have been let go, not him. Confirm this by extending the number of results and make sure nobody else was hired on that day. Then modify the query to return the correct 3 people. Continue to use HireDate as the primary sort column, but use EmployeeId as the tie breaker. Assume that a higher EmployeeId means they were hired later.

Expected : 3 rows (starting with the following)
8   Laura   Callahan    2004-03-04 00:00:00
7   Robert  King        2004-01-02 00:00:00
6   Michael Mitchell    2003-10-17 00:00:00

-- SELECT EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, HireDate FROM Employee ORDER BY EmployeeId DESC, HireDate DESC limit 3; 

GOLD CHALLENGES
-----------------
4. Create a query that shows our 10 biggest invoices by Total value, in descending order. If two invoices have the same Total, the more recent should appear first. The query should also show the Name of the Customer. An Easy way to show the name would be to include the FirstName and LastName columns from the Customer table. However, if you use the concatenation operator you can combine those fields into one column in the results.

Expected: 10 rows
